# Download-Folder-Manager
Ever got frausted while finding files, folders or managing downloads folder ? Me too, therefore I have designed a software which will manage downloads folder easily and regularly.<br>
- It can manage your download folder very conviniently and in disciplined manner.
- It will sort all files and folders to one folder for different-different types of files.
- It can automatically start managing on windows startup
- Easy to install with user friendly interface.

# How It Works ?
Basically it checks all the files in folder and based on their types it sorts the file for example the file type is "PNG" so it will move that file to "Images" folder.<br>
It checks the folder every 15 seconds of interval<br><br>
